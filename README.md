# mealride-api
REST API in Spring

This is the redesigned version of the previous Spring MVC project, which is located here:

https://github.com/Isakots/mealride


My goals in this project were:
- Redesign the project and the database architecture
- Get to know some more and advanced features of Spring Framework, such as:
  - Creating my own validator-annotation
  - Creating an exceptionhandler class with various defined exceptions
  - Using lombok for entity and dto classes
  - Writing tests to all endpoints
-  Trying to write clean code and make it more portable
- Get to know the JWT token authentication
- Being aware of security issues
- Using the Java8 features a lot
